## Sync Waves

In the [`./app_of_apps`](./app_of_apps) directory we create the manifests and helm chart in this sync wave order:

1. all required PVCs, and ExternalSecrets
2. SeaweedFS file system and s3 endpoint with two buckets, one for Postgres backups and one for GoToSocial media
3. Postgresql Cluster
4. GoToSocial helm app

It shows a branching structured flow map that goes from left to right: gotosocial-web-app to gotosocial secret, gotosocial service (which branches to a gotosocial endpoint end endpoint slice), gotosocial service account, gotosocial deployment (which branches to a gotosocial replica set which branches to a gotosocial pod), and finally a gotosocial ingress which branches to a gotosocial TLS certificate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e07af4db-5c55-4142-90c8-6fe61d5b684b" />
