service:
  # -- The type of service to deploy for routing Coturn traffic.
  #   ClusterIP: Recommended for DaemonSet configurations. This will create a
  #              standard Kubernetes service for Coturn within the cluster.
  #              No external networking will be configured as the DaemonSet
  #              will handle binding to each Node's host networking
  #
  #   NodePort:  Recommended for Deployment configurations. This will open
  #              TURN ports on every node and route traffic on these ports to
  #              the Coturn pods. You will need to make sure your cloud
  #              provider supports the cluster config setting,
  #              apiserver.service-node-port-range, as this range must contain
  #              the ports defined above for the service to be created.
